** Tasks
*** Future releases
**** add unit tests with fake trees
***** separate tests for gaps and non-gaps
***** add test dependencies such as pytest and Xvfb
***** try to capture various aspects by emulating python-i3ipc
***** add local machine tests before installation
***** add tests with different virtual environments for dependency versions 
**** improve modularity of code and rename functions to more idiomatic variants
***** improve ~refresh_workspace~ workflow by using ~i3~ as a global variable and query directly
***** re-think necessity of timeout function -> or find easy cross-platform alternative
***** use more pythonic evaluations for variables and lengths in if-statements
**** replace while loop with deterministic for loop in recursive adjustment
***** effect of each size change is checked next to adjacent window and this is done until no negative size effects are found
***** essentially pre-empt the "cannot resize" error by checking these sizes beforehand to prevent loss of some windows
***** useful for edge cases where windows are made so small that they get corrupted
***** "cannot resize" seems to kick in after erroneous resizes in some cases which allows for negative dimensions
**** add new features such as balance vertical/horizontal and balance all workspaces
**** add specific debug script to find sources of errors when they do occur
**** add specific changelog (with versions and updates) and todo's file, have them for different purposes
**** re-do screencasts with keyboard capturing for posterity
**** look into simplifying executable name where dashes are used instead -> simply rename file in ~pyproject.toml~
***** consider adding deprecation message or other fallbacks for backward compatibility -> for example releasing two executables -> add debug message into i3 header for indication
***** release with major version bump for this change
***** update own configurations after that
***** update readme with new usage and warning as well
**** add readme details for development install
***** add details of initializing pre-commit hook
***** add details on replicating virtual environment with lock files
***** add details on running various tests with ~pytest~ and ~mypy~
